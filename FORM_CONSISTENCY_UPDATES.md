# Form Consistency Updates

## Overview
Updated the `EditItemPanel` to be more consistent with the `CreateItemForm` UI and functionality.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. **UI Structure & Layout**
- ✅ Added consistent CSS classes (`create-budget-item-modal`, `form-row`, `modal-button-container`)
- ✅ Organized fields into logical groups using `form-row` divs
- ✅ Improved button layout with proper container structure

### 2. **Component Consistency**
- ✅ Replaced basic `Input` with `SelectWithCreation` for name field
- ✅ Replaced basic `Select` with enhanced `Select` component
- ✅ Used `PriceInput` instead of basic input for amount field
- ✅ Used `useDateInput` hook for consistent date handling
- ✅ Added `Typography` component for consistent headers

### 3. **Form Validation**
- ✅ Added comprehensive form validation similar to CreateItemForm
- ✅ Implemented error state management
- ✅ Added visual error feedback for required fields
- ✅ Added form validation for:
  - Name (required)
  - Price (must be > 0)
  - Account (required)
  - To Account (required for transfers)

### 4. **State Management**
- ✅ Improved state management using `ItemPrimitives` pattern
- ✅ Added proper state update function with logging
- ✅ Better separation of concerns between UI state and business logic

### 5. **User Experience**
- ✅ Added proper loading states
- ✅ Improved button text ("Update Item" instead of misleading "Create")
- ✅ Added Cancel button for better UX
- ✅ Form submission prevention when validation fails
- ✅ Better error messaging

### 6. **Code Quality**
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript typing
- ✅ Added logging for debugging
- ✅ Better error handling with try-catch blocks
- ✅ Consistent code patterns with CreateItemForm

## Technical Details

### Before vs After Comparison

**Before (EditItemPanel):**
- Basic input components
- No form validation
- Simple state management with individual useState hooks
- Inconsistent UI structure
- Misleading button text

**After (EditItemPanel):**
- Consistent input components matching CreateItemForm
- Comprehensive form validation with error states
- Structured state management using ItemPrimitives
- Consistent UI layout with proper CSS classes
- Clear, descriptive button text and actions

### Shared Patterns
Both forms now follow the same patterns for:
- Form field organization
- Validation logic
- Error handling
- State management
- UI structure
- Component usage

## Files Modified
1. `src/apps/obsidian-plugin/panels/CreateBudgetItemPanel/EditItemPanel.tsx` - Major refactor
2. `src/apps/obsidian-plugin/panels/CreateBudgetItemPanel/index.ts` - Added missing exports

## Mobile & Tablet Compatibility
The updated form structure using `form-row` CSS classes should work correctly on tablets and mobile devices as per the workspace rules.

## Next Steps (Optional)
- Consider extracting common validation logic into a shared hook
- Consider creating a shared form field component for further DRY principles
- Add unit tests for the new validation logic
